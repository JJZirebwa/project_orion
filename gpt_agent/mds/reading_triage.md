Reading Triage

This table tracks literature and documentation relevant to Project ORION v2. Items sourced from attached files are cited by filename and line/page numbers; external topics are marked as (Working Theory) until verified via web search.

| ID | Topic | Citation/Source | Why it matters | Notes | Status | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Genomics England registration & governance training | Emails: supervisor instructions to register for GE data and complete IG training | Access to data is contingent on correct registration and governance training; identifies project ID 1077 and supervisor contact details. | Completed training; ensure compliance with data governance. | Digested | Confirm access to TRE and document timeline. |
| 2 | Baseline models: random forest and neural network | Emails: supervisor recommends stating random forest & neural network as planned models | Sets expectations for initial modelling approaches; helps scope technical objectives. | Baseline models will be implemented and compared to GLM. | Digested | Review scikit-learn documentation; prototype logistic, RF and shallow NN. |
| 3 | Equity & service impact considerations | Emails: JJ proposes fairness analysis and service-impact framing per 100 patients | Highlights need to evaluate subgroup performance and to communicate impact in simple terms; introduces sustainability angle. | Equity analysis will be included; service impact template added to governance card. | Digested | Identify fairness metrics and per-100-patients framing in literature. |
| 4 | Module assessment requirements | MDF: 4 000-word dissertation, 1 000-word presentation, 500-word PDP; weighting | Determines deliverables and success metrics; ensures compliance with academic requirements. | Assessment comprises 85 % dissertation, 10 % presentation, 5 % PDP. | Digested | Schedule writing and presentation preparation in sprint log. |
| 5 | Project context: ICD-10 based classification for Brugada syndrome | Project description: summary of rationale and prior work | Provides the core problem statement: using ICD-10 codes as unbiased proxy to classify Brugada cohorts; notes that RF has been tried and deep learning is under exploration. | Sets scope and emphasises TRE environment. | Digested | Extract feature engineering ideas; review literature on ICD-10 encoding. |
| 6 | ICD-10 feature engineering for ML | (Working Theory) | Understanding methods to convert ICD-10 codes into features (e.g. one-hot, count vectors, embeddings) is crucial for model performance and interpretability. | Plan to review papers on using administrative codes for phenotype prediction. | To read | Perform web search and collect 2–3 key papers or tutorials. |
| 7 | Brugada syndrome cohorts & genotype–phenotype correlations | (Working Theory) | Detailed knowledge of Brugada syndrome, prevalence of SCN5A mutations and clinical features will inform label definitions and potential confounders. | Seek epidemiology and genetic studies. | To read | Locate current reviews or guidelines on Brugada syndrome. |
| 8 | Fairness metrics in clinical machine learning | (Working Theory) | Essential for designing subgroup performance analysis and mitigation strategies. Includes TPR parity, equalised odds, calibration and disparity ratios. | Provide methodology for equity plan. | To read | Find foundational papers or tutorials on fairness in healthcare ML. |
| 9 | Service-impact evaluation frameworks | (Working Theory) | Need a template to frame results per 100 patients, showing prioritised referrals and potential resource savings. | Aligns with JJ’s suggestion and governance card. | To read | Search for health-services research papers on triage or risk-stratification impact. |
| 10 | Software-as-a-Medical-Device and AI regulation | (Working Theory) | Provides policy context; helps in documentation and ethical discussion【project_description.docx】. | Understand MHRA and NICE guidelines for academic research. | To read | Review UK SaMD and AI governance frameworks. |
